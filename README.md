**Beautiful, Composable, Programmatic HTML Authoring**

Write a tag. Make a component. Build a site. All in plain JavaScript.

Forget templates. Forget frameworks. Lydio lets you build pure, scalable HTML structures through code â€” readable, modular, and composable from top to bottom.

### Quick Example:

```js
import { Tag } from 'lydio';

const html = new Tag('html');
const head = html.tag('head');
const body = html.tag('body');

body.text('Lydio is Awesome!');

console.log(html.toHtml());

/*
<html><head></head><body>Lydio is Awesome!</body></html>
*/
```

### With Components:

```js
import { Tag } from 'lydio';

class MyHeader extends Tag {
    constructor(brandSrc, brandAlt) {
        super('header');
        const brand = this.tag('a').href('/');
        brand.leaf('img').src(brandSrc).alt(brandAlt);
    }
}

const body = new Tag('body');
body.append(new MyHeader('./lydio-brand.webp', 'A picture of Lydio'));

console.log(body.toHtml());
```

## Features

### API:

- Elegant, clear, and minimal HTML writing.

- Fluent when you want it to be.

- Fully programmatic, full control.

- The programmatic nature allows complex HTML components to be easily made and shared.

### No framework:

- Each piece outputs standard HTML

- No forced bundlers

- No forced server architecture

- No proprietary documents

- No black boxes

# Core Types

3 core types are offered to express HTML they all extend from one base type

### Node (Abstract Base)

Lydio gives you three basic building blocks to express HTML programmatically:

- `Tag`: For regular elements like `<div>`.

- `Leaf`: For self-closing elements like `<img>`.

- `Fragment`: For grouping elements without a wrapper.

These all extend from a shared base `Node` with common methods and properties.

# Advanced Features

## Bubble

Bubbling a node lets a function recursively be applied to all nested nodes. You can transform an entire hierarchy however you want.

Apply BEM, style scopes and more. You can write your own but I provide a default library of these here:

## Components

You can make reusable configurable components easily. Here's a few premade plugins:

- The entire web standard semantics: [@lydio/semantics](https://github.com/alexstevovich/lydio-semantics)

- The head meta web standard: [@lydio/meta](https://github.com/alexstevovich/lydio-meta)

## Audit

#### `audit()`

Check your structure at any time with `.audit()` to catch invalid HTML and get helpful feedback. You can even extend audits on your own components for custom validation.

### Meaning

#### `toMeaning()`

Get a semantic summary of your site, including hidden content like `aria-labels` and `alt` text.

Useful for extracting plain-text structure to share with copy editors or LLMs, or for auditing meaningful content across your project.

Each component can override `toMeaning()` to define its own output.

## Css
